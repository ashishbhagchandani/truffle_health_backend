The application is about Medical Bill upload service
Language: Node
Framework: Express

I have created two API's,
1) A GET endpoint at "/items" to return the list of medical bills stored in the in-memory store.
2) A POST endpoint at "/items" to add a new medical bill to the in-memory store.

To run the application, type "node app.js". The application will start on port 3000. 

To test the application for POST API,
1) Open postman application and type http://localhost:3000/items
2) Select POST method
3) Select body -> raw 
4) Enter the details of patient, example
    {
    "patientName": "Jim B.",
    "patientAddress": "12 N 74th St, NY USA",
    "hospitalName": "NYC City Hospital",
    "dateOfService": "2021-09-05",
    "billAmount": 30
    }
5) A success message will be shown "Medical bill added successfully"

To test the application for GET API,
1) Open postman application and type http://localhost:3000/items
2) Select GET method
3) It will return all the medical bills which were entered using the POST method.
